# Predictive Maintenance – NASA CMAPSS FD001  
### Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation  
**BIL539 – Artificial Intelligence Term Project**

This repository contains all code, analysis, and reports for a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction system developed using the NASA C-MAPSS FD001 turbofan engine dataset.  
The goal is to estimate the operational cycles remaining before failure (RUL) using data-driven machine learning techniques.
